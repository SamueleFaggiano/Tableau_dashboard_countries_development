# Tableau dashboard to outline coutries' development
This Tableau dashboard aims at studying the development of all the countries of the world through different KPIs.
First of all, the distribution of the GDP has been studied. More than 80% of the countries have a GDP lower than 20000$ per capita, as shown below.

The median world GPD is 5550$ per capita. If we look at macro-regions, the following areas have the whole IQR above the median:
* Baltics;
* Northern America;
* Western Europe
While the Sub-Saharan Africa has the whole IQR range below the median.

All the other macro-regions are around the threshold and they have the highest percentage of the world population.

Moreover, all the countries have been evaluated through the following KPIs:
* GDP;
* Birthrate;
* Deathrate;
* Infant mortality;
* Literacy.
The data points have been grouped in 3 clusters: developed, underdeveloped and developing countries. The results are shown in the "Clusters - KPIs" tab and each country can be explored separately. Below we can notice how the countries belonging to the same cluster have the same behaviour in almost every feature. This also confirms that the used features are good descriptors
